  When Hercules had come to the court of King Dexamenus and had violated his daughter Deianira, he was wishing to lead this wife. When Hercules had left, the centaur, Eurytion, sought Dejanira as a wife. Since her father was fearing the centaur, he promised that he would give his daughter in marriage. On a certain day, he came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules intervened, and killed the Centaur, and led Deianira away.
